				<h2>London, Capital of Great Britain</h2>
				<p>London is the capital of Great Britain, its political, economic, and commercial centre. It is one of the largest cities in the world and the largest city in Europe. Its population is about 8 million.</p>
				<p>London is divided into several parts: the City, Westminster, the West End, and the East End.</p>
				<p>The heart of London is the City, its financial and business centre. Numerous banks, offices, and firms are situated there, including the Bank of England, the Stock Exchange, and the Old Bailey. Few people live here, but over a million people come to the City to work. There are some famous ancient buildings within the City. Perhaps the most striking of them is the St. Paul's Cathedral, the greatest of English churches. It was built in the 17th century by Sir Christopher Wren. The Tower of London was founded by Julius Caesar and in 1066 rebuilt by William the Conqueror. It was used as a fortress, a royal palace, and a prison. Now it is a museum.</p>
				<p>Westminster is the governmental part of London......</p>

						<h3>Tradition of England</h3>
						<p>
							England is a special country. It is generally believed that English people respect their traditions very much. Itâ€™s true and one of the well known English traditions is tea-drinking.
						</p>
						<p>
							In Britain, the drinking of tea is so varied that it is quite hard to generalise. While it is usually served with milk, it is not uncommon to drink it black or with lemon, with sugar being a popular addition to any of the above. 
						</p>
						<p>
							This tradition was introduced in England by Anna, the seventh Duchess of Bedford, in the year 1840. 
						</p>
						<p>
							At what time English people traditionaly drinck tea?
